/**
 * This version of the heartbeat protocol measures round trip times for pings
 * using the local clock. The heartbeat messages carry bits that represent
 * pings. One end initiates pinging and the other responds. So the one end sends
 * a set bit until it sees a set bit in return. When it does it records the time
 * and changes to sending a cleared bit. When it sees a cleared bit it records
 * the time and changes back to sending a set bit. The other end does the
 * reverse - it sends a cleared bit until it sees a set bit, and then sends a
 * set bit until it sees a cleared bit.
 * 
 * The time between one bit flip and the next is a round trip time. The protocol
 * uses the (local clock) times to measure the round trip and determine
 * timeliness, so this protocol works without synchronized clocks. Essentially
 * it only measures measage transmission delay and scheduling delay, not clock
 * skew.
 * 
 * However, as the clocks are not measured, the upper layers cannot rely on
 * timestamps to represent a global time reference. Accordingly the partition
 * stability time reference is meansingless across the partition, it only
 * reflects the local time when the partition stablizes. Hence view time stamps
 * are not reported.
